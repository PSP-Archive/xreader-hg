History:

1. Changed: Fixed a few compiler warnings.
2. Changed: Added better documentation of BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY compiler setting.

Monkey's Audio 4.10

1. Changed: When compressing a file, the input WAV file is always opened in read-only mode (writes were never done, but previously the input WAV would only be opened in read-only mode if write permissions were not available).
2. Changed: Updated to newer nasm compiler for MMX assembly.
3. Changed: Updated the console application (MAC.exe) to support Unicode filenames (GUI has always had Unicode support).
4. Changed: Removed obsolete Unicode compatibility DLL (unicows.dll) from the installer (only used by Win 9x).

Monkey's Audio 4.09

1. Changed: Updated to an icon that looks nicer on Windows 7 (sorry, still a monkey).
2. Changed: Updated copyright dates.

Monkey's Audio 4.08

1. Fixed: The decoder could unnecessarily try to analyze the file tag when starting a streaming APE file.
2. Changed: Switched to Visual Studio 2008 for compilation.

Monkey's Audio 4.07

1. Fixed: A corrupted APE tag could cause an otherwise valid file to fail to be loaded.
2. Fixed: Improved handling of corrupt frames during decoding.

Monkey's Audio 4.06

1. Fixed: In rare cases, a corrupt frame could output as noise instead of silence when the decoder was ignoring errors.

Monkey's Audio 4.05

1. Fixed: Directshow filter would fail to register on some systems.
2. Changed: Added CompressFileW2, DecompressFileW2, etc. functions that take a C++ interface as a callback for easier usage in multi-threaded environments. (as opposed to the old static function callback)

Monkey's Audio 4.04

1. Fixed: Directshow filter had an unnecessary dependence on a MSVC system dll.

Monkey's Audio 4.03

1. Changed: Added a help link to the help menu to show the included help file.

Monkey's Audio 4.02

1. NEW: Includes Directshow filter for decoding APE files in any DirectShow compatible player like Windows Media Player, Zoom, etc.
2. Fixed: Corrupt APE files could cause decoder crashes in rare cases.
3. Changed: Updated builder that gets better compression, making for a smaller download.

Monkey's Audio 4.01 Beta 3

1. Fixed: Added handling to correct any APE files where the APEv2 tag got appended as terminating WAV data after conversion. (fixed a long time ago -- this just deals with any afflicted files)

Monkey's Audio 4.01 Beta 2

1. Fixed: File > Exit would not close the program.
2. Fixed: Typo on the options dialog "Leave source file intact" option.
3. Fixed: APX files that weren't NULL terminated could cause a crash.
4. Fixed: Files that were skipped would show "Error" instead of "Skipped" in the status column.
5. Changed: Improved the error reporting in the status column after a failure.
6. Fixed: Possible small memory leak (100 bytes) on missing file decompression / conversion errors.
7. Changed: Increased the statusbar size to better hold batches of 100+ GBs of files.
8. Changed: The file list will scroll to show newly started files during processing.
9. Fixed: Adding or removing files from the file list is no longer allowed during processing.
10. Changed: Pausing processing no longer distorts the time estimation.
11. Fixed: Some operations would not pause properly. (external encoders, etc.)
12. Fixed: The list control would flicker more than necessary when working with long lists of files.

Monkey's Audio 4.01 Beta 1

1. Fixed: Corrupt / invalid APEv2 tags could cause problems in some cases.
2. Fixed: APL creation could use track boundaries that were off by 1/44100th of a second in some cases.
3. Fixed: APL creation would not properly report errors when the CUE file didn't point to an existing APE file.
4. Fixed: In very rare cases, decoding an old APE file could cause an invalid decompression error.
5. Fixed: When converting from APE -> APE, the APEv2 tag could get appended as WAV data to the new file. (instead of as a file tag)

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 4

1. Fixed: Decoder could erroneously report a CRC error on the last frame of some files.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 3

1. Changed: Worked on making data types more standard / cross-platform friendly.
2. Changed: Switched code from tab-based to space based. (may still be some out-of-whack formatting)
3. Fixed: Building ID3 tags could cause a crash.
4. Fixed: APL builder treated the last part of a CUE time as a hundreth of a second instead of as a frame. (1 / 75 of a second)
5. Fixed: File Info dialog used by Winamp plugin wouldn't accept / save Unicode tag values properly.
6. Fixed: APL files could output noise or silence at the end of the file in some cases.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 2

1. Fixed: Possible buffer overflow attack weakness in APE tagging code.
2. Fixed: MACDll.dll was not doing ANSI to Unicode conversions properly.
3. Changed: Added Unicode versions of interface wrappers to MACDll.dll.
4. Changed: Updated Winamp plugin to better handle Unicode.
5. Changed: Removed peak-level normalize from file and Winamp plugin. (newer players can do normalize / replay gain during playback)
6. Changed: Updated Cool Edit filter to 3.99.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 1

1. Fixed: MACDll.dll wasn't working on Win9x / ME systems.
2. Changed: MAC.exe updated to 3.99.

Monkey's Audio 3.99

2. Changed: Simplified assembly code building for 3rd party developers.
3. NEW: Improved entropy coder for increased compression.
4. Changed: Removed RKAU support. (since it is no longer commonly used)

Monkey's Audio 3.98a1

2. Changed: Using smaller frame sizes with Fast, Normal, and High for faster, smoother seeking.
3. NEW: Added built-in MD5 checking, for super secure, super fast file verification.
4. Changed: Using a new and improved file header format.
5. NEW: Added "Insane" mode for when compression is all that matters.
6. NEW: Introduced new GUI.
    - full Unicode support
    - few or no dependencies
    - multi-thread friendly -- can process multiple files at once
    - XML based external plugin architecture

Monkey's Audio 3.97 (July 7, 2002)

1. Changed: "Save File List Between Sessions" now on by default in front end.
2. Changed: Replaced usage of "#pragma once" with more non-MS compiler friendly alterternative.
3. NEW: MakeAPL now supports command line APL generation. (pass a .CUE file (no wildcards yet) -- operates in silent mode using existing settings)
4. Changed: Assembly support no longer required for backwards compatibility. (thanks Torgeir Strand Henriksen)
5. Changed: Several non-Windows buildability issues.
6. Changed: Using NASM to compile all assembly code. (aids cross-platform buildability)

9. Changed: Added more functionality to the APL parser.
10. Changed: Added CreateIAPEDecompressEx2(...) to allow the creation of a ranged decoder.

Monkey's Audio 3.96 (April 7, 2002)

1. Fixed: WAV analysis could hang on invalid wav files.
2. Changed: Monkey's Audio would try to analyze files with file extensions not related to Monkey's Audio.
3. NEW: Added APE_DECOMPRESS_AVERAGE_BITRATE field so APL's can report the bitrate for the region they represent.
4. Changed: Improved overall non-Windows build-ability. (MACLib.lib doesn't require <windows.h> to build)
5. Changed: APL parser no longer requires Windows.
6. Fixed: APE tagging code would fail to save tags for files with existing ID3v1 tags.

11. Fixed: Bitstream fix / change that may have accounted for decompression failures in extremely rare cases.
12. Changed: Slight NNFilter optimization. (thanks to Chun-Yu Shei)
13. Changed: Turned off "Explorer" by default for the Monkey's Audio GUI. (doesn't work well under XP... will still leave it in for a while)
